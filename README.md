# reversi-ai

- write/obtain implementation of reversi
    - input: moves using the standard notation XY -> [a-h][1-8]
    - output: state of reversi board (2D array of 0,1,2)
- write search algorithm
    - input: state of reversi board (2D array of 0,1,2)
    - output: a legal move OR skip turn

- considerations
    - how does the search algorithm know whether a move is legal?
    - how can the system work for both black and white players?
